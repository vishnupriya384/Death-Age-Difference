# Death-Age-Difference
Investigating whether there is a significant difference in the age at death between left-handed and right-handed individuals, considering various demographic and health-related factors.
# Result
Our study shows that changes in left-handedness rates over time explain the 5.5-year life expectancy difference observed. 
This method can be applied to other epidemiological studies affected by evolving cultural norms, offering insights into how such shifts impact research outcomes.
